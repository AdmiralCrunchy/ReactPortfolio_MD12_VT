                Hello! My name is Vincent Tate and I am a junior developer starting out my new adventure into the field. I come from a long background of leadership and face to face customer service and looking for something new in my career path. 
                I am really excited about working as a full stack developer and searching for a position that will challenge and my skill set. Hope to work with other driven individuals that feel the same way and who can help me to be a better developer
                as well.
            </p>
